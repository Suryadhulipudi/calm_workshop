**Calm Workshop â€“ Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**

**SDLC Objectives**
*******************

Successful projects are managed well. In order to manage a project efficiently, the manager or dev team must choose which software development method works best for the project at hand.  All of the numerous software development methodologies that exist are used for different reasons. I've been doing some research to understand why different methodologies exist, and which ones are the most commonly used software development methodologies.



SDLC Introduction

- Understanding the fundamentals of SDLC.  A **software development life cycle** is composed of a number of clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used by systems engineers and systems developers to plan for, design, build, test, and deliver information systems.


Waterfall Development Model

- Considered the traditional software development method, the waterfall method is a rigid linear model that consists of sequential phases (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance) in which distinct goals are accomplished. Each phase must be 100% complete before moving onto the next phase, and traditionally there is no process for going back to modify the project or direction.

Spiral Development Model

- Repetition model with incremental improvements.


Iterative Development Model

- Model that emphasizes repetition.


Agile Development Model

- Model based on division of work.


Test Driven Development Model

- Model based on development around test acceptance.
