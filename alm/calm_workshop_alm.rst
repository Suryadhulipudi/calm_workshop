**Introduction**
****************

Application lifecycle management (ALM) is the supervision of a software application from its initial planning through
retirement. It also refers to how changes to an application are documented and tracked.

**Application Lifecycle Management**

ALM is a very broad term that reflects a change in attitude towards software development that is also expressed in the term DevOps. DevOps blends the tasks performed by a company's application development and systems operations teams. In the past, a development team might work independently using a waterfall development model and hand off the completed software application to an operations team for deployment and maintenance. Today, it is more likely that developers will use an agile model and remain involved with the application after deployment, working with business owners and operations to make incremental changes as needed.  

There are many ALM tools available for tracking application changes. These range from dedicated ALM products that monitor an application from inception to completion, automatically sorting files into logical buckets as changes are noted, to simple wikis that require team members to record changes manually.

**Application Portfolio Management**

Application portfolio management (APM) is a framework for managing enterprise IT software applications and software-based services. APM provides managers with an inventory of the company's software applications and metrics to illustrate the business benefits of each application.


An APM system uses a scoring algorithm for generating reports about the value of each application and the health of the IT infrastructure as a whole. By gathering metrics like an application's age, how often it's used, the cost it takes to maintain it and its interrelationships with other applications, a manager can use more than just an educated guess to decide whether or not a particular application should be kept, updated, retired or replaced.
